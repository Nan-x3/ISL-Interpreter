# Indian Sign Language Interpreter
We're working on an AI model that translates Indian sign language to text on the screen. 
## Overview: Our AI model detects hand signs/gestures of the Indian sign language and generates speech in English in real time.
The AI model aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
## Usage: Our AI model uses a camera to recognize the gestures and generates text in real time.
